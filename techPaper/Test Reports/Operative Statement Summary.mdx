## Report Types Available

### 1. Summary Report Only
- Standard maritime industry format
- Category-level totals for current month and YTD
- Single-page PDF with fund receipts and operating expense categories
- Suitable for executive reporting and quick financial overview

### 2. Detailed Report (Summary + Details)
- **Page 1**: Summary section (identical to summary-only report)
- **Page 2+**: Detailed account-wise breakdown with both current month and YTD amounts
- Account-level transactions organized by category
- Complete audit trail with account codes, descriptions, and amounts
- Suitable for detailed financial analysis and audit purposes

## Prerequisites

### Required Files
1. **Budget Category CSV**: Account code mapping file (e.g., `budget_category_data.csv`)
2. **ShipNet Tool Access**: MCP vessel accounts tool for expense data retrieval
3. **Account Code Categories**: Predefined 999-account mappings for accruals and committed costs

### System Requirements
- Python 3.x with required libraries:
  - `reportlab` for PDF generation (primary requirement)
  - `json`, `csv` for data processing
  - `datetime` for date filtering
  - `collections` for data organization

## Data Sources and Strategy

### 1. Account Code Management

#### Primary Account Codes (from CSV)
```csv
_id,createdAt,createdAtIst,category,accountCode
687d19d1431e8c3b75848c75,2025-07-20T16:31:13.020Z,2025-07-20T22:01:13.020Z,ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES,6176-116
```

#### 999 Account Code Categories (Accruals/Committed Costs)
```python
categories_999 = {
    '5320-999': 'ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES',
    '5120-999': 'CREW EXPENSES',
    '5115-999': 'CREW WAGES',
    '5110-999': 'CREW WAGES',
    '5162-999': 'DRYDOCKING EXPENSES',
    '5170-999': 'EXTRA ORDINARY ITEMS',
    '5160-999': 'INSURANCE',
    '5152-999': 'LUBE OIL CONSUMPTION',
    '5156-999': 'MANAGEMENT FEES',
    '5158-999': 'MISCELLANEOUS',
    '5166-999': 'NON-BUDGETED EXPENSES',
    '5164-999': 'PRE-DELIVERY EXPENSES',
    '5165-999': 'PRE-DELIVERY EXPENSES',
    '5154-999': 'REPAIRS & MAINTENANCE',
    '5150-999': 'SPARES',
    '5144-999': 'STORES',
    '5130-999': 'VICTUALLING EXPENSES'
}
```

### 2. Data Querying Strategy

#### Step 1: Query Vessel Expenses from ShipNet Tool
```python
# Use MCP vessel_expenses tool
vessel_expenses = mcp.callTool("vessel_expenses", {
    "vesselCode": "VESSEL_CODE",  # Use actual vessel code
    "limit": 10000
})
```

#### Step 2: Filter by Time Periods
- **Current Month**: Filter expenses for specific month
- **Year-to-Date (YTD)**: Filter expenses from January 1st to current month end
- **Use posting date field** for accurate period filtering

#### Step 3: Account Code Filtering
- Combine CSV account codes with 999 account codes
- Implement pattern-based categorization for unmapped accounts
- Filter vessel expenses to include only relevant accounts
- Exclude balance sheet accounts (1xxx, 2xxx series) from operating expenses
- Ensure no account codes are missed or duplicated

### 3. Fund Receipt Handling

#### Fund Receipt Account Codes
```python
fund_receipt_accounts = {
    '2110-100': 'OWN VSL FUND A/C (AD OPEX FUN)',  # Budget Fund
    '2110-200': 'OWN VSL FUND CA (NB REP FUND)',   # Non-Budget Fund
    '2110-150': 'Additional Budget Fund',
    '2110-250': 'Additional Budget Fund',
    '2110-350': 'Additional Budget Fund',
    '2110-550': 'Additional Budget Fund'
}
```

#### Critical Rules for Fund Receipts
- **Always use `abs(amount)` for fund receipts**
- Fund receipts in system are typically negative but should show as positive in reports
- This ensures proper calculation of operative surplus/deficit
- **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING**: Only use the accounts specified above (2110-xxx series)
- **DO NOT** include internal transfer accounts like 2100-104, 2100-100 as fund receipts
- These are budget transfer accounts, not actual fund receipts for operative statements

### 4. Category Mapping Strategy

#### Pattern-Based Account Categorization
For accounts not found in CSV mappings, implement pattern-based categorization:
```python
common_patterns = {
    # Crew related
    '5110': 'CREW WAGES',
    '5115': 'CREW WAGES', 
    '5120': 'CREW EXPENSES',
    
    # Stores and supplies
    '5130': 'VICTUALLING EXPENSES',
    '5140': 'STORES',
    '5142': 'STORES',
    '5144': 'STORES',
    '5150': 'SPARES',
    '5152': 'LUBE OIL CONSUMPTION',
    
    # Repairs and maintenance
    '5154': 'REPAIRS & MAINTENANCE',
    
    # Management and admin
    '5156': 'MANAGEMENT FEES',
    '5158': 'MISCELLANEOUS',
    '5320': 'ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES',
    '6176': 'ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES',
    
    # Insurance and extraordinary
    '5160': 'INSURANCE',
    '5162': 'DRYDOCKING EXPENSES',
    '5164': 'PRE-DELIVERY EXPENSES',
    '5165': 'PRE-DELIVERY EXPENSES',
    '5166': 'NON-BUDGETED EXPENSES',
    '5170': 'EXTRA ORDINARY ITEMS'
}
```

#### Standard Category Mapping
```python
category_mapping = {
    'CREW EXPENSES': 'Crew Expenses',
    'CREW WAGES': 'Crew Wages', 
    'VICTUALLING EXPENSES': 'Victualling Expenses',
    'STORES': 'Stores',
    'SPARES': 'Spares',
    'LUBE OIL CONSUMPTION': 'Lube oil Consumption',
    'REPAIRS & MAINTENANCE': 'Repairs & Maintenance',
    'MANAGEMENT FEES': 'Management Fee',
    'MISCELLANEOUS': 'Miscellaneous',
    'PRE-DELIVERY EXPENSES': 'Pre-Delivery Expenses',
    'ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES': 'Administrative Expenses',
    'DRYDOCKING EXPENSES': 'DryDocking Expenses',
    'INSURANCE': 'Insurance',
    'NON-BUDGETED EXPENSES': 'Non-Budgeted Expenses',
    'EXTRA ORDINARY ITEMS': 'Extra Ordinary Items'
}
```

#### Category Priority Order (for Report Display)
1. Crew Wages

### 3. Detailed Report Implementation Guidelines

#### Account-Level Data Processing
```python
def process_expenses_with_accounts(current_expenses, ytd_expenses):
    """Process expenses and create account-wise breakdown with both current and YTD amounts"""
    fund_receipt_accounts = defaultdict(lambda: {'current': 0, 'ytd': 0, 'description': ''})
    operating_accounts = defaultdict(lambda: {'current': 0, 'ytd': 0, 'description': '', 'category': ''})
    
    # Process current month and YTD expenses separately
    # Aggregate by account code while preserving descriptions and categories
    # Return structured data for detailed report generation
```

#### Detailed Section Layout Specifications
- **Page Size**: A4 (same as summary)
- **Margins**: 0.5 inch all sides
- **Font**: Helvetica (8pt for detailed data, 9pt for headers)
- **Table Structure**: 4 columns (Account Code, Description, Current Month, YTD)
- **Column Widths**: 1.2", 2.8", 1.5", 1.5"
- **Category Grouping**: Organized by expense categories with subtotals
- **Grid Lines**: Light grey grid for readability

#### Data Validation for Detailed Reports
- [ ] All accounts have proper descriptions
- [ ] Current month amounts ≤ YTD amounts (logical validation)
- [ ] Category subtotals match summary page totals
- [ ] Fund receipt accounts properly identified
- [ ] No duplicate account entries within categories
- [ ] All operating accounts properly categorized

### 4. Amount Formatting Rules (Applied to Both Report Types)

#### Positive Amounts
```
Format: XXX,XXX.XX
Example: 213,840.00
```

#### Negative Amounts (Deficits)
```
Format: (XXX,XXX.XX)
Example: (82,956.61)
```

#### Zero Amounts
```
Format: 0.00
```

## Implementation Code Templates

### 1. Summary Report Generator
```python
def generate_summary_pdf(vessel_code, report_month, report_year, csv_file_path, output_directory):
    """Generate summary-only operative statement PDF"""
    # Implementation for summary report only
    pass
```

### 2. Detailed Report Generator (NEW)
```python
def generate_detailed_pdf(vessel_code, report_month, report_year, csv_file_path, output_directory):
    """Generate detailed operative statement PDF with summary + account breakdown"""
    # Implementation for detailed report with both summary and detailed sections
    
    # Key components:
    # 1. Create summary section (Page 1)
    # 2. Create detailed fund receipts section (Page 2)
    # 3. Create detailed operating expenses by category (Page 2+)
    # 4. Include category subtotals
    # 5. Maintain consistent formatting and headers
    pass
```

### 3. Account-Level Data Processing (NEW)
```python
def process_expenses_with_accounts(current_expenses, ytd_expenses):
    """Process expenses for detailed account-wise reporting"""
    # Aggregate by account code
    # Preserve account descriptions
    # Calculate both current month and YTD amounts
    # Categorize accounts properly
    # Return structured data for detailed reporting
    pass
```

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Cross-Reference Validation

#### Compare Summary vs Detailed Totals
- Verify category totals in detailed section match summary page
- Check fund receipt totals consistency
- Validate operative surplus/deficit calculations
- Ensure YTD amounts include current month amounts

#### Account-Level Validation (NEW for Detailed Reports)
- Verify all accounts have proper descriptions
- Check for duplicate account entries
- Validate account code categorization
- Ensure no accounts are missing from detailed breakdown

### 2. Mathematical Validation

#### Balance Verification
```
Operative Surplus = Funds Receipt - Operating Expenses
```

#### YTD Logic Check
```
YTD Amount >= Current Month Amount (for all accounts and categories)
```

#### Detailed Report Consistency (NEW)
```
Sum of Account Details = Category Total (for each category)
Sum of Category Totals = Operating Expenses Total
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Detailed Report Specific Issues (NEW)

#### Issue: Account Details Don't Match Category Totals
**Solution**: 
- Verify account categorization logic
- Check for missing or miscategorized accounts
- Validate aggregation calculations
- Ensure consistent date filtering for current and YTD

#### Issue: Detailed Report Performance with Large Data Sets
**Solution**:
- Implement efficient data aggregation
- Use appropriate data structures (defaultdict)
- Optimize PDF table generation for large account lists
- Consider pagination for very large detailed reports

#### Issue: Account Descriptions Truncated
**Solution**:
- Implement smart text truncation (35-40 characters)
- Add ellipsis (...) for truncated descriptions
- Ensure critical account information remains visible
- Consider tooltip or full description in separate column

### 2. Existing Issues (Apply to Both Report Types)

#### Missing Account Codes
**Issue**: New account codes not in CSV mapping
**Solution**: 
- Add new codes to CSV file
- Update 999 account mapping if needed
- Implement pattern-based categorization for common account prefixes
- Re-run report generation

#### Incorrect Fund Receipt Signs
**Issue**: Fund receipts showing as negative
**Solution**: 
- Always use `abs(amount)` for fund receipts
- Verify fund receipt account identification logic
- **CRITICAL**: Only use accounts specified in guidelines (2110-xxx series)

## Report Selection Guidelines

### When to Use Summary Report Only
- Executive reporting and board presentations
- Quick financial performance overview
- Monthly management reports
- High-level stakeholder communication
- When detailed account breakdown is not required

### When to Use Detailed Report
- **Audit purposes and compliance requirements**
- **Detailed financial analysis and budget variance analysis**
- **Account-level expense tracking and monitoring**
- **Investigation of specific expense categories**
- **Preparation for external audits**
- **Internal control and expense validation**
- **Training and educational purposes for accounting staff**

## PDF Generation Automation Guidelines (Enhanced)

### 1. Report Type Selection

    vessel_code: str,
    report_month: int,
    report_year: int,
    csv_file_path: str,
    output_directory: str,
    report_type: str = "summary"  # "summary" or "detailed"
) -> str:
    """
    Generate operative statement PDF with specified report type
    Returns: PDF file path
    """
    if report_type == "detailed":
        return generate_detailed_pdf(vessel_code, report_month, report_year, csv_file_path, output_directory)
