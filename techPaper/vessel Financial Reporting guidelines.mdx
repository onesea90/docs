  - `pandas`, `openpyxl` for Excel generation
  - `json`, `csv` for data processing
  - `datetime` for date filtering
  - `collections` for data organization

## Data Sources and Strategy

### 1. Account Code Management

#### Primary Account Codes (from CSV)
```csv
_id,createdAt,createdAtIst,category,accountCode
687d19d1431e8c3b75848c75,2025-07-20T16:31:13.020Z,2025-07-20T22:01:13.020Z,ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES,6176-116
```

#### 999 Account Code Categories (Accruals/Committed Costs)
```python
categories_999 = {
    '5320-999': 'ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES',
    '5120-999': 'CREW EXPENSES',
    '5115-999': 'CREW WAGES',
    '5110-999': 'CREW WAGES',
    '5162-999': 'DRYDOCKING EXPENSES',
    '5170-999': 'EXTRA ORDINARY ITEMS',
    '5160-999': 'INSURANCE',
    '5152-999': 'LUBE OIL CONSUMPTION',
    '5156-999': 'MANAGEMENT FEES',
    '5158-999': 'MISCELLANEOUS',
    '5166-999': 'NON-BUDGETED EXPENSES',
    '5164-999': 'PRE-DELIVERY EXPENSES',
    '5165-999': 'PRE-DELIVERY EXPENSES',
    '5154-999': 'REPAIRS & MAINTENANCE',
    '5150-999': 'SPARES',
    '5144-999': 'STORES',
    '5130-999': 'VICTUALLING EXPENSES'
}
```

### 2. Data Querying Strategy

#### Step 1: Query Vessel Expenses from ShipNet Tool
```python
# Use MCP vessel_expenses tool
vessel_expenses = mcp.callTool("vessel_expenses", {
    "vesselCode": "VESSEL_CODE",  # Replace with actual vessel code
    "limit": 10000
})
```

#### Step 2: Filter by Time Periods
- **Current Month**: Filter expenses for specific month and year
- **Year-to-Date (YTD)**: Filter expenses from January 1st to end of specified month
- **Use posting date field** for accurate period filtering

#### Step 3: Account Code Filtering
- Combine CSV account codes with 999 account codes
- Implement pattern-based categorization for unmapped accounts
- Filter vessel expenses to include only relevant accounts
- Exclude balance sheet accounts (1xxx, 2xxx series) from operating expenses

### 3. Fund Receipt Handling

#### Fund Receipt Account Codes
```python
fund_receipt_accounts = {
    '2110-100': 'OWN VSL FUND A/C (AD OPEX FUN)',  # Budget Fund
    '2110-200': 'OWN VSL FUND CA (NB REP FUND)',   # Non-Budget Fund
    '2110-150': 'Additional Budget Fund',
    '2110-250': 'Additional Budget Fund',
    '2110-350': 'Additional Budget Fund',
    '2110-550': 'Additional Budget Fund'
}
```

#### Critical Rules for Fund Receipts
- **Always use `abs(amount)` for fund receipts**
- Fund receipts in system are typically negative but should show as positive in reports
- This ensures proper calculation of operative surplus/deficit
- **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING**: Only use the accounts specified above (2110-xxx series)
- **DO NOT** include internal transfer accounts like 2100-104, 2100-100 as fund receipts

## Generation Process

### 1. Operative Statement Generation

#### Summary Report
```bash
python generate_operative_statement.py --vessel=VESSEL_CODE --month=MONTH --year=YEAR
```
This generates a single-page PDF with category-level totals for current month and YTD.

#### Detailed Report
```bash
python generate_detailed_operative_statement.py --vessel=VESSEL_CODE --month=MONTH --year=YEAR
```
This generates a multi-page PDF with summary page + detailed account breakdown + CSV export.

### 2. Manager Statement Generation

#### Excel Report
```bash
python generate_manager_statement_excel.py --vessel=VESSEL_CODE --month=MONTH --year=YEAR
```
This generates an Excel file matching the template structure with opening/closing balance, fund receipts, and categorized expenses.

#### CSV Export Options
```bash
# For specific month only with budget filtering
python generate_monthly_manager_statement.py --vessel=VESSEL_CODE --month=MONTH --year=YEAR

# For comprehensive export with all fields
python generate_manager_statement_csv.py --vessel=VESSEL_CODE --month=MONTH --year=YEAR

# For budget-filtered export
python generate_budget_filtered_manager_statement.py --vessel=VESSEL_CODE --month=MONTH --year=YEAR
```

### 3. All-in-One Generation
```bash
python generate_all_statements.py --vessel=VESSEL_CODE --month=MONTH --year=YEAR
```
This runs all the statement generation scripts in sequence and validates the outputs.

- Document the generation process and parameters
- Archive reports systematically for future reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Missing Account Codes
**Issue**: New account codes not in CSV mapping
**Solution**: 
- Add new codes to CSV file
- Update 999 account mapping if needed
- Implement pattern-based categorization for common account prefixes
- Re-run report generation

#### Incorrect Fund Receipt Signs
**Issue**: Fund receipts showing as negative
**Solution**: 
- Always use `abs(amount)` for fund receipts
- Verify fund receipt account identification logic
- Only use accounts specified in guidelines (2110-xxx series)

#### Excel Format Issues
**Issue**: Excel format doesn't match template
**Solution**:
- Verify column headers match template
- Check section ordering (opening balance, fund receipts, operating expenses, closing balance)
- Ensure proper date formatting
- Validate calculations for totals and balances

## Documentation
A comprehensive documentation file should be maintained for each vessel with detailed instructions for generating all report types.

## Report Selection Guidelines

### When to Use Summary Report Only

- Quick financial performance overview
- Monthly management reports
- High-level stakeholder communication
- When detailed account breakdown is not required

### When to Use Detailed Report

- **Detailed financial analysis and budget variance analysis**
- **Account-level expense tracking and monitoring**
- **Investigation of specific expense categories**
- **Preparation for external audits**
- **Internal control and expense validation**
- **Training and educational purposes for accounting staff**

### When to Use Manager Statement Excel
- For accounting teams requiring transaction-level details
- When opening and closing balances are needed
- For compatibility with existing accounting workflows
- When a familiar Excel format is required

### When to Use CSV Exports
- For data import into other accounting systems
- For custom analysis in spreadsheet applications
- For data transformation and manipulation
- For archival and data warehouse purposes
