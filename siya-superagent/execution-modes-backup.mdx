## Two Powerful Ways to Work with Siya

Siya offers two distinct execution modes, each with its own architecture and strengths. Understanding these modes helps you choose the best approach for your specific needs.

## Mode Overview

### Chat Mode - Interactive Intelligence with Tools & Sub-Agents
- **Architecture**: Siya agent with direct tool access + spawnable sub-agents
- **Interaction**: Real-time conversation with immediate responses
- **Flexibility**: Iterate, refine, and explore as you go
- **Best For**: Learning, debugging, exploration, quick tasks

### Task Mode - Autonomous Orchestration of Agent Modules  
- **Architecture**: Siya orchestrator managing dedicated agent modules
- **Execution**: Autonomous planning and execution
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for complex, multi-step operations
- **Best For**: Production work, complex projects, automation

## Chat Mode Deep Dive

### Architecture in Chat Mode

When you select Chat Mode, Siya operates with:

**Direct Tool Access**:
- File operations (read, write, edit, multi-edit)
- Search tools (glob, grep, semantic search)
- Execution tools (bash, terminal)
- Web tools (browser, search)
- Planning tools (todo management)
- MCP integration

**Spawnable Sub-Agents**:
- **SWE Agent** - For complex coding tasks
- **Search Agent** - For research needs
- **Browser Agent** - For web automation
- **Automation Agent** - For workflow tasks

**Key Features**:
- Auto-compacting memory management
- Context preservation across conversation
- Multiple sub-agents can run in parallel
- Real-time tool execution

### When to Use Chat Mode

**Perfect for:**
- **Exploration** - "I want to understand how this works"
- **Learning** - "Teach me about React hooks"
- **Debugging** - "Help me fix this error"
- **Iterative Work** - "Let's refine this solution"
- **Quick Tasks** - "Format this JSON file"
- **Interactive Development** - "Let's build this feature together"

### How Chat Mode Works

1. **You Ask** - Natural conversation style
2. **Siya Analyzes** - Determines best approach
3. **Tool Usage** - Direct execution for simple tasks
4. **Sub-Agent Spawning** - For complex domain-specific needs
5. **Interactive Response** - Real-time feedback
6. **Iteration** - Refine based on results

### Chat Mode Examples

**Example 1: Quick Coding Help**
```
You: Create a Python function to validate email addresses
Siya: I'll create a Python function for email validation using regex...
[Uses tools directly to create and test the function]
```

**Example 2: Complex Research**
```
You: Research the best practices for microservices architecture
Siya: I'll research microservices best practices for you...
[Spawns Search Agent to gather comprehensive information]
```

**Example 3: Debugging Session**
```
You: My React app shows a white screen, help me debug
Siya: Let me help you debug this issue. First, let's check...
[Interactive debugging using tools and possibly SWE Agent]
```

## Task Mode Deep Dive

### Architecture in Task Mode

When you select Task Mode, Siya transforms into an orchestrator managing:

**Dedicated Agent Modules**:
- **Planning Module** - Strategic planning and coordination
- **SWE Agent Module** - All software engineering (with MCP access)
- **Browser Agent Module** - Web automation and scraping
- **Search Agent Module** - Research and information gathering
- **Automation Agent Module** - Complex workflow execution

**Key Differences**:
- No direct tool access (agents handle tools internally)
- Autonomous coordination between modules
- Comprehensive planning before execution
- SWE module has exclusive MCP server access

### When to Use Task Mode

**Ideal for:**
- **Complete Projects** - "Build a full-stack web application"
- **Complex Analysis** - "Analyze this dataset and create a dashboard"
- **Automation** - "Set up a CI/CD pipeline"
- **Production Work** - "Refactor this codebase"
- **Multi-Step Operations** - "Migrate database and update all services"
- **Hands-Off Execution** - "Create a complete documentation site"

### How Task Mode Works

1. **You Define** - Clear requirements and goals
2. **Planning Module** - Creates comprehensive strategy
3. **Agent Coordination** - Modules work in parallel/sequence
4. **Autonomous Execution** - No intervention needed
5. **Progress Updates** - Stay informed of status
6. **Complete Delivery** - Full solution provided

### Task Mode Examples

**Example 1: Application Development**
```
You: Build a task management web app with user authentication
Planning Module: Creating comprehensive plan...
[Orchestrates SWE, Browser, and other modules to build complete app]
```

**Example 2: Data Pipeline**
```
You: Create an automated data analysis pipeline for sales data
Planning Module: Designing data pipeline architecture...
[Coordinates modules to build end-to-end solution]
```

**Example 3: System Migration**
```
You: Migrate our Node.js app from Express to Fastify
Planning Module: Analyzing migration requirements...
[SWE module handles code changes with MCP integration support]
```

## Mode Comparison

| Aspect | Chat Mode | Task Mode |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Architecture** | Siya + Tools + Sub-Agents | Siya Orchestrator + Agent Modules |
| **Interaction** | Interactive, conversational | Define requirements, autonomous execution |
| **Tool Access** | Direct tool usage | Agents handle tools internally |
| **MCP Access** | Available to main Siya | Exclusive to SWE module |
| **Planning** | Incremental, as-needed | Comprehensive upfront planning |
| **Execution** | Step-by-step with feedback | Autonomous end-to-end |
| **Best For** | Exploration, learning, debugging | Production, complex projects |
| **Response Time** | Immediate | Planning phase + execution |
| **Flexibility** | High - change direction anytime | Lower - follows the plan |
| **Memory** | Auto-compacting, conversational | Task-focused, efficient |

## Choosing the Right Mode

### Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Chat Mode when:**
- You're exploring or learning
