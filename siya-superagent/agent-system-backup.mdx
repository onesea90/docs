## Overview

Siya employs a sophisticated multi-agent architecture that adapts based on your chosen execution mode. At the core is the main Siya agent, which either directly handles tasks using tools and sub-agents (Chat Mode) or orchestrates specialized agent modules (Task Mode).

## Architecture by Mode

### Chat Mode Architecture

In Chat Mode, Siya operates as an intelligent assistant with direct access to:

**Tools & Capabilities**:
- File operations (read, write, edit)
- Search tools (glob, grep, semantic search)
- Execution tools (bash commands, terminal)
- Web tools (browser automation, web search)
- Planning tools (todo management)
- MCP integration for extended capabilities

**Sub-Agents Available**:
- **SWE Agent** - Software engineering tasks
- **Search Agent** - Information gathering
- **Browser Agent** - Web automation
- **Automation Agent** - Workflow automation

These sub-agents can be spawned multiple times as needed, with auto-compacting enabled for efficient memory management.

### Task Mode Architecture

In Task Mode, Siya transforms into an autonomous orchestrator managing dedicated agent modules:

**Agent Modules**:
- **Planning Module** - Creates and manages execution plans
- **SWE Agent Module** - Handles all software engineering (with MCP access)
- **Browser Agent Module** - Web interaction and automation
- **Search Agent Module** - Research and information gathering
- **Automation Agent Module** - Complex workflow execution

These modules work together autonomously without direct tool access, coordinated by Siya's orchestration layer.

## The Main Siya Agent

### Core Capabilities

Siya is your primary interface and the intelligence behind all operations:

**In Chat Mode**:
- Interactive conversation with context preservation
- Direct tool usage for immediate tasks
- Spawns specialized sub-agents when needed
- Manages memory with auto-compacting
- Provides real-time responses

**In Task Mode**:
- Analyzes complex requirements
- Creates comprehensive execution plans
- Coordinates agent modules
- Monitors progress and handles errors
- Delivers complete solutions

### Intelligent Decision Making

Siya automatically determines:
- Which tools or agents to use
- When to spawn sub-agents
- How to coordinate multiple operations
- When to switch approaches
- How to optimize for efficiency
