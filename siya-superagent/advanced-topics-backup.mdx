## Unlock Siya's Full Potential

This guide covers advanced features and techniques for power users who want to maximize their productivity with Siya. These capabilities go beyond basic usage to provide sophisticated workflows and integrations.

## Advanced Agent Techniques

### Agent Specialization in Chat Mode

**Direct Agent Requests**
Leverage specific sub-agents for specialized tasks:
- "Use the SWE agent to refactor this codebase"
- "Have the browser agent extract data from these websites"
- "Get the search agent to research recent developments"
- "Use the automation agent to set up this workflow"

**Agent Spawning Strategies**
- Multiple instances of the same agent can run in parallel
- Auto-compacting ensures efficient memory usage
- Agents share context through Siya's memory system
- Optimal for complex, multi-faceted tasks

### Module Coordination in Task Mode

**Orchestration Patterns**
- Planning module creates comprehensive strategies
- Agent modules execute in optimal sequence
- Parallel execution where dependencies allow
- SWE module leverages MCP for extended capabilities

**Advanced Planning**
- Multi-phase execution plans
- Conditional branching based on results
- Resource optimization across modules
- Adaptive replanning when needed

## MCP Server Integration

### Advanced MCP Configuration

**Dynamic Server Loading**
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "dynamic-loader": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["mcp-loader.js"],
            "env": {
                "CONFIG_PATH": "./servers/",
                "AUTO_DISCOVER": "true"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Chained MCP Servers**
Connect multiple MCP servers for complex workflows:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "data-pipeline": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["pipeline-server.py"],
            "env": {
                "SOURCE_DB": "postgres://source",
                "TARGET_API": "https://api.target.com",
                "TRANSFORM_RULES": "./rules.json"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Enterprise Integration**
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "enterprise-suite": {
            "command": "java",
            "args": ["-jar", "enterprise-mcp.jar"],
            "env": {
                "SAP_ENDPOINT": "https://sap.company.com",
                "SALESFORCE_INSTANCE": "na1.salesforce.com",
                "AZURE_AD_TENANT": "company.onmicrosoft.com"
            },
            "maskedFields": ["env.SAP_ENDPOINT", "env.AZURE_AD_TENANT"]
        }
    }
}
```
