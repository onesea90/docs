## Additional Notes for Image Generation:

1. **Style Reference**: Similar to modern DevOps architecture diagrams from AWS, Google Cloud, or Kubernetes documentation
2. **Aspect Ratio**: 1200x1000 pixels (slightly taller than wide to accommodate all layers)
3. **File Format**: Generate as high-resolution PNG or SVG
4. **Typography**: Use clean, modern sans-serif fonts (Inter, Roboto, or system fonts)
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds
