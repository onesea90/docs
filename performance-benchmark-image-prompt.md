## Alternative Simplified Version for Quick Generation

```
Create a clean performance comparison dashboard (1400x900px) with white background showing:

1. Bar chart comparing task completion times (SIYA: 2.3min in blue, others 3.5-5.1min in gray)
2. Radar chart showing SIYA scoring 85-98% across metrics vs others at 65-85%
3. Feature matrix with SIYA having all green checkmarks vs competitors' mixed results
4. Key stats: "65% Faster", "98.5% Accuracy", "10x Parallel Processing"

Use modern flat design with SIYA in bright blue (#0000FF), competitors in gray. Add trophy icons for winning metrics. Professional tech aesthetic.
```

This prompt will generate a comprehensive performance benchmark visualization that clearly shows SIYA's advantages over competitors like Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor.
